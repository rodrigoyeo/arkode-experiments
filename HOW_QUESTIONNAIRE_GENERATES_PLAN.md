# How the Questionnaire Generates Your Odoo Implementation Plan

This document explains how each question in the questionnaire is used to generate your customized Odoo implementation plan, including both template-based tasks and AI-generated tasks.

## Overview: Hybrid Approach (Templates + AI)

The planner uses a **hybrid approach** combining two task generation methods:

1. **Template Tasks (70-80%)**: Pre-defined, battle-tested tasks from Arkode's experience with 500+ Odoo implementations
2. **AI-Generated Tasks (20-30%)**: Custom tasks generated by OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo or Claude 3.5 Sonnet based on your specific requirements

This ensures you get both proven best practices AND customization for your unique business needs.

## Phase 2: Implementation Phase (Building the Solution)

### Template Tasks Source
- **File**: `task-library.json`
- **Contains**: 500+ module-specific implementation tasks

### How Questionnaire Responses Control Implementation Tasks

| Question | How It's Used | Impact on Tasks |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Modules to Implement** | Filters task library | Only tasks matching selected modules are included |
| **Custom Modules** | Creates custom module tasks | Generates 5-8 implementation tasks per custom module |
| **Hour Allocation (Implementation)** | Scales task hours | Distributes hours across module + custom tasks |
| **Arkode Team Members** | Assigns tasks by role | Uses intelligent role-based assignment:<br>- Developers → Development tasks<br>- Process Consultants → Configuration tasks<br>- Project Manager → Review tasks |
| **Language** | Controls task names | Spanish: Uses `name_es`, English: Uses `name` |

### Implementation Tasks: Standard Modules

**Example: If you select "Accounting" module**, you get these tasks:

1. **Chart of Accounts Configuration** - 8 hours
   - Description: Configure chart of accounts according to local regulations

---

## Phase 3: Adoption Phase (Training & Go-Live)

### Template Tasks Source
- **File**: `task-library-updates/adoption-phase-improved.json`
- **Contains**: 12 standard tasks for the 4-week adoption phase

### How Questionnaire Responses Control Adoption Tasks

| Question | How It's Used | Impact on Tasks |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Language** | Controls task names | Uses `name_es` or `name` field |
| **Hour Allocation (Adoption)** | Scales task hours | All 12 tasks scale proportionally |
| **Modules to Implement** | Affects training scope | More modules = more training sessions needed (handled by hour scaling) |
| **Arkode Team Members** | Assigns training tasks | Process Consultants → Training tasks<br>Developers → Technical training<br>PM → Go-live coordination |

### Adoption Phase Standard Tasks (Always Included)

1. **Training Materials Development** (Week 1) - 8 hours
2. **User Training - Admin Users** (Week 1) - 6 hours

**Questions Sent to AI:**
- `business_requirements`: Business goals to measure success
- `training_needs`: Specific training requirements mentioned
- `modules`: Modules requiring training
- `custom_modules`: Custom functionality requiring documentation

**AI Prompt for Adoption Phase:**
```
Generate 3-5 training, go-live, and adoption tasks for an Odoo implementation project.

Client Context:
- Business Requirements: {business_requirements}
- Training Needs: {training_needs}
- Modules Implemented: {modules list}
- Custom Modules: {custom_modules list}

Focus on:
- Role-specific training for modules implemented
- Training for custom_modules functionality

- "Custom Module Training: Backlog Facturación for Finance Team"
- "Power User Certification Program"

These tasks are assigned to the **"Capacitación y Go-Live"** milestone.

---

## Task Assignment Logic

### Intelligent Role-Based Assignment

The system assigns tasks to team members based on **task tags** and **team member roles**:

```javascript
// Process Consultant Assignment
if (task.tags.includes('Process Consultant') ||
    task.tags.includes('Process Design') ||
    task.tags.includes('Process Mapping')) {
  // Assign to team member with "Process Consultant" role
}

// Developer Assignment
if (task.tags.includes('Odoo Developer') ||
    task.tags.includes('Development') ||
    task.tags.includes('Customization')) {
  // Assign to team member with "Developer" role
}

// Project Manager Assignment
if (task.tags.includes('Project Management') ||
    task.tags.includes('Kickoff') ||
    task.tags.includes('Stakeholder Alignment')) {
  // Assign to designated Project Manager
}

// Training Tasks
if (task.tags.includes('Training')) {
  // Prefer Process Consultants, fallback to any team member
}
```

**Your team member selections** determine who gets assigned which tasks.

---

## Hour Allocation and Scaling

### How Hour Allocation Works

You specify total hours for each phase:
- Clarity Phase: e.g., 72 hours
- Implementation Phase: e.g., 200 hours
- Adoption Phase: e.g., 83 hours

**The system scales all tasks proportionally:**

1. **Calculate template task total**: Sum of all baseline hours
2. **Calculate scale factor**: `your_hours / template_total`
3. **Scale each task**: `task_hours * scale_factor`

**Example for Clarity Phase:**
- Template total: 72 hours (sum of 11 tasks)
- You allocate: 96 hours
- Scale factor: 96 / 72 = 1.33
- "Stakeholder Interviews" (8h) → 8 * 1.33 = 10.64 hours
- "Master of Implementation" (16h) → 16 * 1.33 = 21.28 hours

### Hour Distribution

**Clarity Phase (72 baseline hours):**
- Week 1-2 (Discovery): 36 hours (50%)
- Week 3 (Optimizing): 15 hours (20%)
- Week 4 (Master of Implementation): 21 hours (30%)

**Implementation Phase (varies by modules):**
- Standard module tasks: 70% of hours
- Custom module tasks: 20% of hours
- AI integration tasks: 10% of hours

**Adoption Phase (83 baseline hours):**
- Week 1-2 (Training): 40 hours (48%)
- Week 3 (Go-Live Prep): 20 hours (24%)
- Week 4 (Go-Live & Support): 23 hours (28%)

---

## Milestone Generation

### How Milestones Are Created

**Clarity Phase Milestones:**
1. **Mapeo de Procesos** (Process Mapping) - Week 1-2 tasks
2. **Diseño To-Be** (To-Be Design) - Week 3 tasks
3. **Master of Implementation** - Week 4 tasks

**Implementation Phase Milestones:**
- One milestone per module: "Implementación del módulo de {Module}"
- One milestone per custom module: "Implementación de {Custom Module Name}"
- One milestone for data: "Migración de Datos"

**Adoption Phase Milestones:**
1. **Capacitación** (Training) - Week 1-2 tasks
2. **Capacitación y Go-Live** (Training & Go-Live) - Week 3-4 tasks
3. **Soporte Post Go-Live** (Post Go-Live Support) - Week 4 tasks

**Your language selection** determines if milestones are in Spanish or English.

## How to Get Better AI-Generated Tasks

### Tips for High-Quality AI Tasks

1. **Be Specific in Business Requirements**
   - ❌ Bad: "We need better processes"
   - ✅ Good: "We need automated approval workflows for purchase orders over $10K, with email notifications to department heads and CFO"

2. **Detail Your Current Systems**
   - ❌ Bad: "We use some software"
   - ✅ Good: "SAP for finance, Salesforce for CRM, custom Access database for inventory, Excel for reporting"

3. **Explain Pain Points Clearly**
   - ❌ Bad: "Things are slow"
   - ✅ Good: "Manual data entry between systems causes 2-3 day delays in order processing, leading to lost sales"

4. **Name Custom Modules Descriptively**
   - ❌ Bad: "Module 1", "Custom Thing"
   - ✅ Good: "Backlog Facturación" (describes purpose), "Workflow Aprobaciones Multi-nivel"

5. **Specify Training Needs**
   - ❌ Bad: "Normal training"
   - ✅ Good: "Sales team of 50 needs mobile CRM training, warehouse team needs barcode scanning training, finance team needs advanced reporting training"

### What AI Considers When Generating Tasks

**AI analyzes your responses for:**
- Keywords indicating complexity (e.g., "integration", "custom", "automated")
- System names to research integration methods
- Industry-specific terminology for relevant tasks
- Regulatory requirements (e.g., "SOX compliance", "GDPR")
- Scale indicators (number of users, transaction volume)
- Technical debt mentions (legacy systems, manual processes)

**AI tries to avoid:**
- Duplicating template tasks already included
- Generic tasks that add no value
- Tasks outside Odoo's capabilities
- Unrealistic hour estimates

## Conclusion

The questionnaire generates your plan through a sophisticated combination of:

1. **Battle-tested templates** from 500+ implementations
2. **AI customization** for your unique requirements
3. **Intelligent assignment** based on team member roles
4. **Proportional scaling** based on your hour allocations
5. **Language localization** for Spanish or English output
6. **Smart milestone organization** by deliverables

Every question serves a purpose - either controlling which templates are used, how they're customized, or providing context for AI to generate additional relevant tasks.

**Pro Tip**: The more detailed your responses to "Business Requirements", "Current Systems", "Pain Points", and "Training Needs", the more valuable and specific your AI-generated tasks will be!
