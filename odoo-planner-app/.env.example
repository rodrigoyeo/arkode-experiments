# AI API Keys for Task Customization
# You can use EITHER Claude OR OpenAI (not both)
# The app will automatically detect which one you've configured

# Option 1: Claude API (Anthropic)
# Get your key from: https://console.anthropic.com/
# Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
# Cost: ~$0.10-0.20 per plan
VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY=

# Option 2: OpenAI API
# Get your key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# Model: GPT-4 Turbo
# Cost: ~$0.15-0.25 per plan
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=

# Priority: If both keys are provided, Claude will be used first
# Leave empty to disable AI customization (app works fine without it)
